This package is a best-effort static HTML/CSS/JS conversion of the provided Figma Make design.
Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
Instructions:
1. Unzip the package (cafe_static_site.zip).
2. Open index.html in your browser. For local script behavior, most features work by simply opening the file.
3. To serve via a local server (recommended), run: npx serve . or python -m http.server 8000 in the folder.
Notes:
- Images and fonts are represented by placeholders or Google Fonts. If you have exported assets from Figma, replace the placeholder backgrounds with real images in styles.css or inside the HTML.
- This is a manual conversion; minor visual differences from the original Figma design may exist.
